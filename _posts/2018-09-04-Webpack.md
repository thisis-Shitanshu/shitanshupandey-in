For quick Webpack bundling snippet, click [here.](https://gist.github.com/thisis-Shitanshu/3573407eb8b0ef61a256b32e7869a2a8)

- Webpack only understands JavaScript (any code other than import and export statements.) and JSON files. 
    - `Loaders` allow webpack to process (transform) other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.
    - The test property identifies which file or files should be transformed.
    - The use property indicates which loader should be used to do the transforming.
    - When using other ES2015 features, make sure to use a transpiler such as Babel or Bublé.
    - `Plugins` can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like;
        - bundle optimization, 
        - asset management and, 
        - injection of environment variables.
    - To use a plugin, you need to require() it and add it to the plugins array.
    - `Mode` can enable webpack built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment. 

## #Asset Management
- Before webpack, front-end developers would use tools like grunt and gulp to process these assets and move them from their /src folder into their /dist or /build directory.
 - Webpack will dynamically bundle all dependencies (creating what's known as a dependency graph). 
 - The file and URL loaders will take any file you load through them and output it to your build directory.

## #Code Split
- There are three general approaches to code splitting available:
    - Entry Points: Manually split code using entry configuration.
    - Prevent Duplication: Use the SplitChunksPlugin to dedupe and split chunks.
    - Dynamic Imports: Split code via inline function calls within modules.


## #Source Map
Source maps, which map your compiled code back to your source code. If an error originates from b.js, the source map will tell you exactly that.
    - devtool: 'inline-source-map'

# #Steps Setup
```
 $ npm install webpack --save-dev
 $ npm install webpack-cli --save-dev
```

- Add a `webpack.config.js` file to the root directory.

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); //installed via npm
const webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins
const path = require('path');
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'production',
    // "production" | "development" | "none"

    entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
    // string | object | array
    // defaults to ./src

    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        // must be an absolute path (use the Node.js path module)
        filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            { 
                test: /\.txt$/, 
                include: [
                    path.resolve(__dirname, "app")
                ], // optional
                exclude: [
                    path.resolve(__dirname, "app/demo-files")
                ], // optional
                // Use arrays of absolute paths in include and exclude
                use: 'raw-loader' 
            },
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    'style-loader',
                    'css-loader'
                ]
            },
            {
                test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|gif)$/,
                use: [
                    'file-loader'
                ]
            },
            // OR file-loader for other types of file.
            {
                test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/,
                use: [
                    'file-loader'
                ]
            },
            // Loading Data, CSVs, TSVs, and XML.
            {
                test: /\.(csv|tsv)$/,
                use: [
                    'csv-loader'
                ]
            },
            {
                test: /\.xml$/,
                use: [
                    'xml-loader'
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({template: './src/index.html'})
    ]
};

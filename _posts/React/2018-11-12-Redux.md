Notes on Redux

# #Introduction
- Redux allows React State to be more scalable.
    - Avoid use of drill-prop among nested React Component.
- Redux uses an architectural pattern called flux pattern.
    1. Action
    1. Dispatcher
    1. Store
    1. View

## #Why?
- Good for managing large state.
- Useful for sharing data between components.
- Predictable state management using the 3 principles.
    1. Single source of truth.
    1. State is read only.
    1. Changes using pure functions.

# #Redux Flow:
1. Actions
    - Middleware: Get action before they reach the Root Reducer.
    - E.g.: Redux logger
1. Root Reducer (pure function (action): state)
1. Store
1. DOM Changes

# #Reducer
- A function that gets state and playload as arrgument and returns state object.

```js
const userReducer = (currentState, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
        case 'SET_CURRENT_USER':
            return {
                ...state,
                currentUser: action.payload
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};
```

# #Implementing Redux
- `yarn add redux redux-logger react-redux`
- Add `Provide` from `react-router` to the root of the app.
- Create Root reducer.
    - Create sub-reducer for specific accounts.
    - Combine them in root reducer and export combined state object.
- Create a store using Root reducer.
- Pass store in provider.

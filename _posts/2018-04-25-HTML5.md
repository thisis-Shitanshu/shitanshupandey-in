A cheat sheet on HTML5: the HyperText Markup Language.

## #HTML Document
- `class` can be assigned to multiple elements but `id` should always be assigned to a single element in the project.
- `div` is a block element.
- An HTML document is read from top to bottom, so always add the JS after the element it is referring to is defined.
    - If you add the JS before the element is defined in a document. JS will be processed first and won't be able to find the element it has implementations for.
    - While working with Heading elements from h1 to h6, use them to define the priority of the text. 
    - Instead of the size, they show, then use CSS to change the size of the text.

### #Head Elements & Scripts
```html
<head>
    <title>Learning HTML</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content="My first HTML website">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com.releases/v5.0.6/css/all.css">

    <script>
        h1 {
            text-align: center;
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
```
- Elements, according to the order above:
    - `head`
        - title
        - charset: Describes the characters used in the HTML document.
        - description: For SEO puropse.
        - viewport: For Responsive Layout.
        - Refering to stylesheet in the same directory.
        - Refering to stylesheet from 3rd party provider.
        - Embedded script element.
    - `body`
        - Refering to script in the same directory.

### #Layout Elements
- Earlier we used to use `div` to define all kinds of element.
    - To diffrentate between elements we use to use classes.
- HTML5 has provided us tags for most commonly used elements:
    - `header` tag.
        - `nav` tag: For Navigations.
    - `section` tag: better alterantive to `div`.
        - `main` tag: 
            - Better suited to describe only specific content for the document. 
            - Not to be used for repeated contnent like `header` and `footer`.
        - `article` tag.
    - `aside` tag: For add, menu.
    - `footer` tag.

## #Figure & Image Elements
```html
<figure>
    <img src="exteral link | refer to image from the project directory" alt="description"/>
    <figcaption>
        Caption to the image above.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

## #Embedding Videos
```html
<video 
    src="exteral link | refer to video from the project directory"
    controls
    autoplay
    muted
    loop
    preload
    width="600px"
    height="350px" 
>
```
- Video Element is not responsive by default. Best practise is to nest inside an element which can make it responsive.
- Video element can take source as its child element.
    - It's a good practise because it enables us to immplement fallback video formats for different browser.

```html
<video 
    src="exteral link | refer to video from the project directory"
    controls
    autoplay
    muted
    loop
    preload
    width="600px"
    height="350px" 
>
    <source
        src="exteral link | refer to video from the project directory"
        type="video/mp4"
    >
    <source
        src="exteral link | refer to video from the project directory"
        type="video/ogg"
    >
</video>
```
- Another way to embedded video is to use `iframe`

```html
<iframe
    width="600"
    height="350"
    src="website URL | Video embedded URL from YouTube."
></iframe>
```

## #Navbar & List Items
- List elements are block elements.

```html
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

## #Paragraph & Texting format
- `b`: bold
- `strong`: also bold but a higher priority.
- `i`: italics
- `em`: emphasis, also italic but a higher priority.
- `mark`: highlighted.
- `a`: link.
- `br`: break tag.
    - Instead of using multiple break tags in the paragraph to show a separate paragraph. Use the `p` tag, it's a block element. It will start on the next line.
- `blockquote cite=" Source of Quote URL"`

```html
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com">
    "Quote!" - Me, Myself and I.
</blockquote>
```
- `code`: Code without indentation.
- `pre`: Code with indentation.
- `q`: Short quote.

## #Tables
```html
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <!--<th colspan="3">Table Data</th>-->
            <th>First Name</th>
            <th>Second Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <colgroup>
            <col 
                style="background-color: blueviolet;" 
                span="2"
            >
        </colgroup>
        <colgroup>
            <col style="background-color: yellow;">
        </colgroup>
        <tr>
            <!--<td rowspan="3">Table Data</td>-->
            <td>John</td>
            <td>Doe</td>
            <td>Email</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>Doe</td>
            <td>Email</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

## #Page Linking
```html
<nav>
    <ul>
        <!--Refering to blank id '#' on the document.-->
        <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#item2">Item 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="item3.html">Item 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```
- Sidebar code:

```html
<div id="offcanvas-left" class="hide">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#item2">Item 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="item3.html">Item 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="togglebar">
    <!--adds the class of hide to .offcanvas.left-->
    <div class="toggle" onclick="toggleLeft()">
        <i class="fa fa-bars"></i>
    </div>
</div>
```

# #Key Points to note
- What does a doctype do?
    - When performing HTML validation testing on a web page it tells the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) validator which version of (X)HTML standard the web page coding is supposed to comply with.
    - It tells the browser how to render the page in standards compliant mode.
- How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
    - Click [here.](https://maksimivanov.com/posts/serve-page-in-multiple-languages/)
- What are data- attributes good for?
    - It is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
    - It gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.
    - The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
    
    ```html
    <ul>
        <li data-animal-type="bird">Owl</li>
        <li data-animal-type="fish">Salmon</li> 
        <li data-animal-type="spider">Tarantula</li> 
    </ul>
    ```
- Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
    - Semantics: allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.
    - Connectivity: allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.
    - Offline and storage: allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently.
    - Multimedia: making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.
    - 2D/3D graphics and effects: allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.
    - Performance and integration: providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.
    - Device access: allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.
    - Styling: letting authors write more sophisticated themes.
- Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
    - sessionStorage, localStorage and Cookies all are used to store data on the client side. Each one has its own storage and expiration limit:
        - LocalStorage: stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser Cache / Locally Stored Data
        - SessionStorage: similar to localStorage but expires when the browser closed (not the tab).
        - Cookie: stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side (normally from server-side).
    - Cookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.
- Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.
    - `<script>`
        - Let’s start by defining what `<script>` without any attributes does. The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it’s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.
    - `<script async>`
        - async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.
    - `<script defer>`
        - defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are also guaranteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.
- What is progressive rendering?
    - Progressive rendering is a rendering mode in which the program gradually updates small parts of the entire image refining it from low quality to final result rather than focusing on one small part of the image at a time.
- Why you would use a srcset attribute in an image tag?
    - The srcset attribute specifies the URL of the image to use in different situations.
    - This attribute is required when `<source>` is used in `<picture>`.

    ```html
    <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_pink_flowers.jpg">
        <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_white_flower.jpg">
        <img src="img_orange_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width:auto;">
    </picture>
    ```
- Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
    - Jade, ERB, Slim, Handlebars, Jinja, Liquid, just to name a few. 
    - They are more or less the same and provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. 
    - Most templating engines will also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you need custom processing before display.
